## Project idea

"Balda" is a simple, but interesting game, which is played (usually) on 5x5 field. Each cell of the field can contain one character. 
Game begins with 5-letter word in middle of the field: 

![game created](https://github.com/tmelent/balda/blob/master/github_screenshots/genfield.PNG?raw=true)

Every turn player has to add a letter in an empty field and connect existing letters with this one to make a word.

If the word exists, the player gets points equal to the length of the entered word.

Game lasts until every field is filled. 

Connections can be only vertical or horizontal.
